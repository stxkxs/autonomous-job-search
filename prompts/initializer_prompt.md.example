## IMPORTANT: Multi-ATS Search

Search ALL of these ATS platforms - don't limit to just one:

| Platform | Domain | Search Pattern |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Greenhouse | `boards.greenhouse.io` | `site:boards.greenhouse.io` OR `site:greenhouse.io` |
| Lever | `jobs.lever.co` | `site:jobs.lever.co` OR `site:lever.co` |
| Ashby | `jobs.ashbyhq.com` | `site:jobs.ashbyhq.com` OR `site:ashbyhq.com` |
| Workable | `apply.workable.com` | `site:apply.workable.com` OR `site:workable.com` |

## Step 1: Setup Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p data/jobs data/companies
[ -f data/jobs/jobs.json ] || echo "[]" > data/jobs/jobs.json
[ -f data/companies/companies.json ] || echo "{}" > data/companies/companies.json
```

## Step 2: Search for Jobs (Multi-Platform)

Use **WebSearch** with varied queries across ALL platforms:

### Greenhouse Searches
```
site:boards.greenhouse.io "staff platform engineer" remote 2025
site:boards.greenhouse.io "infrastructure engineer" "kubernetes" remote
site:greenhouse.io "developer experience" "golang" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "staff engineer" "AWS" "terraform" remote
```

### Lever Searches
```
site:jobs.lever.co "staff platform engineer" remote
site:jobs.lever.co "infrastructure" "kubernetes" remote
site:lever.co "backend engineer" "distributed systems" remote
site:jobs.lever.co "SRE" "golang" remote
```

### Ashby Searches
```
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com "platform engineer" remote

site:jobs.lever.co/netlify
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/ramp
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/vercel
site:boards.greenhouse.io/hashicorp
```

### General Tech Searches (will find various ATS)
```
"staff platform engineer" remote kubernetes 2025
"infrastructure engineer" golang terraform remote
"developer experience engineer" remote
```

## Step 3: For Each Job Found

### A. Verify ATS Platform
Check the URL to identify the platform:
- `greenhouse.io` → Greenhouse
- `lever.co` → Lever
- `ashbyhq.com` → Ashby
- `workable.com` → Workable

If URL is company careers page, look for Apply button linking to one of these ATS platforms.

### B. Fetch Full Job Details
Use **WebFetch** to extract:
- Complete job description
- All requirements (required vs nice-to-have)
- Tech stack mentioned
- Team information
- Salary range (if listed)
- Location requirements

### C. Research Company
For each new company, search:
```
"Company Name" glassdoor rating engineering
"Company Name" crunchbase funding series
"Company Name" engineering blog tech stack
"Company Name" layoffs 2024 2025
"Company Name" linkedin employees
```

Save company info to `data/companies/companies.json`.

## Step 4: Score Each Job (0-100)

### 90+ (Priority)
- Staff/Principal level explicitly stated
- Platform, Infrastructure, or DevEx focus
- Remote US or Austin-based
- Tech stack overlap >80% (Go, K8s, AWS, Terraform)
- Strong company signals (Series B+, good Glassdoor)

### 85-89 (Strong Match)
- Senior with Staff potential
- Related focus (SRE, Backend infrastructure)
- Most core skills match
- Interesting technical challenges

### 80-84 (Good Match)
- Senior level
- Partial stack overlap
- Would need to ramp on 1-2 technologies
- Decent company

### Below 80 (Skip or Note)
- Mid-level roles
- Poor location fit
- Minimal stack overlap
- Company red flags

## Step 5: Prepare Application Materials

For each job scoring 80+, prepare:

### Why This Company
```
[2-3 sentences connecting their mission/product to candidate's interests and values]
```

### Why This Role
```
[How specific experience maps to their stated needs]
```

### Experience to Highlight
```
- [Vercel achievement relevant to this role]

- [Relevant certification]
```

### Questions to Ask
```
- [Technical question showing depth]

- [Question showing you researched them]
```
