2. Are Remote (US) OR located in Your City

## Step 1: Setup (Preserve Existing Data)

```bash
mkdir -p data/jobs data/companies
# Only create if doesn't exist - NEVER overwrite
[ -f data/jobs/jobs.json ] || echo "[]" > data/jobs/jobs.json
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always READ existing `data/jobs/jobs.json` first and APPEND new jobs. Never overwrite existing entries. Check for duplicates by job_url before adding.

## Step 2: Search for Jobs

Use **WebSearch** with queries tailored to your skills:

### Platform/SRE Roles
```
site:boards.greenhouse.io "staff platform engineer" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "senior SRE" remote USA
site:boards.greenhouse.io "site reliability engineer" "[cloud]" "[orchestration]"

```

### Backend/Software Engineer
```
site:boards.greenhouse.io "staff software engineer" "[language]" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "senior backend engineer" "[framework]" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "staff engineer" "[cloud]" "[orchestration]" remote

```

## Step 6: Save to Catalog
