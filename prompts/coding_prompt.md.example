# Job Catalog Builder - Continue

Continue building the job catalog. **Search new queries and platforms** to find more opportunities.

## Step 1: Load Existing Catalog

```bash
cat data/jobs/jobs.json 2>/dev/null || echo "[]"
cat data/companies/companies.json 2>/dev/null || echo "{}"
```

**Before searching:**
1. Count existing jobs
2. Extract all `job_url` values (for duplicate checking)
3. Note which ATS platforms are already represented
4. Identify companies already researched

## Step 2: Search Strategy - Expand Coverage

### A. Search Platforms Not Yet Covered
If existing jobs are mostly Greenhouse, prioritize Lever/Ashby/Workable searches.

### B. Try New Query Variations

**Role Title Variations:**
```
site:boards.greenhouse.io "platform engineer" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "infrastructure engineer" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "developer experience" engineer remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "devops engineer" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "site reliability" remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "backend engineer" "infrastructure" remote
```

**Skill-Focused Queries:**
```
site:jobs.lever.co "kubernetes" "platform" remote
site:jobs.lever.co "terraform" "AWS" remote
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com "golang" "infrastructure" remote
site:apply.workable.com "python" "devops" remote
```

**Seniority Variations:**
```
site:boards.greenhouse.io "staff" platform remote
site:jobs.lever.co "senior" infrastructure remote
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com "principal" engineer remote
site:boards.greenhouse.io "lead" platform remote
```

**Company-Specific (High-Value Targets):**
```
# Developer Tools
site:boards.greenhouse.io/launchdarkly
site:boards.greenhouse.io/postman
site:jobs.lever.co/snyk
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/linear

# Infrastructure
site:boards.greenhouse.io/hashicorp
site:boards.greenhouse.io/cockroachlabs
site:jobs.lever.co/planetscale
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/railway

# Fintech
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/ramp
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/brex
site:boards.greenhouse.io/plaid
site:jobs.lever.co/mercury

# Observability
site:boards.greenhouse.io/grafana
site:boards.greenhouse.io/chronosphere
site:jobs.lever.co/honeycomb
```

**Time-Bounded Searches:**
```
"staff platform engineer" remote 2025
"infrastructure engineer" kubernetes hiring 2025
"platform team" golang remote January 2025
```

## Step 3: Process Each New Job Found

### A. Check for Duplicates FIRST
```python
existing_urls = [job["job_url"] for job in existing_jobs]
if new_job_url in existing_urls:
    skip  # Already cataloged
```

### B. Identify ATS Platform
From the URL:
- `greenhouse.io` → `"ats_platform": "greenhouse"`
- `lever.co` → `"ats_platform": "lever"`
- `ashbyhq.com` → `"ats_platform": "ashby"`
- `workable.com` → `"ats_platform": "workable"`

### C. Fetch Complete Job Details
Use **WebFetch** on the job URL to get:
- Full description (not just title)
- All requirements listed
- Nice-to-haves vs must-haves
- Tech stack mentioned anywhere
- Team size/structure if mentioned
- Salary range (check multiple places)
- Remote policy details
- Visa/work auth requirements

### D. Research Company (If New)
Check if company already in `companies.json`. If not:
```
"Company Name" glassdoor rating engineering culture
"Company Name" crunchbase funding investors
"Company Name" engineering blog
"Company Name" tech stack infrastructure
"Company Name" layoffs 2024 2025
"Company Name" employee reviews
```

## Step 4: Score and Prepare Materials

### Scoring Rubric (Reminder)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90+ | Staff+, Platform/Infra focus, Remote US, 80%+ stack match, strong company |
| 85-89 | Senior+, related focus, most skills match, good company |
| 80-84 | Senior, partial match, interesting challenges |
| <80 | Skip or note for later |

### Application Materials (For 80+ Jobs)

**Why This Company:**
- What do they build that interests you?
- How does their mission connect to your values?
- What about their engineering culture appeals?

**Experience to Highlight:**
Map YOUR specific achievements to THEIR requirements:
```
Their Requirement → Your Achievement
"Kubernetes expertise" → "Led EKS platform serving 200+ services at Stripe"
"Developer tools experience" → "Built deployment platform for 50k devs at Vercel"
"Observability background" → "Architected tracing pipeline at Datadog (2M spans/sec)"
```

**Questions to Ask:**
- Technical depth question about their architecture
- Team/process question showing genuine interest
- Growth/roadmap question showing long-term thinking

## Step 5: Update Catalog (APPEND Only)

```python
# Pseudocode - NEVER overwrite existing entries
existing = json.load("data/jobs/jobs.json")
existing_urls = {j["job_url"] for j in existing}

new_jobs = []
for job in found_jobs:
    if job["job_url"] not in existing_urls:
        job["id"] = f"job-{len(existing) + len(new_jobs) + 1:03d}"
        new_jobs.append(job)

combined = existing + new_jobs
json.dump("data/jobs/jobs.json", combined)
```

### Required Fields for Each Job
```json
{
  "id": "job-XXX",
  "job_url": "https://...",
  "ats_platform": "greenhouse|lever|ashby|workable",
  "company": "Company Name",
  "role": "Exact Title",
  "location": "Remote (US) | City, ST | Hybrid",
  "salary": "$XXXk-$XXXk | Not listed",
  "found_date": "2025-01-15",
  "match_score": 87,
  "requirements": ["Req 1", "Req 2"],
  "tech_stack": ["Tech 1", "Tech 2"],
  "responsibilities": ["Resp 1", "Resp 2"],
  "company_size": "XXX-XXX | Unknown",
  "glassdoor_rating": "X.X | N/A",
  "funding": "Series X ($XXM) | Public | Unknown",
  "why_good_fit": "Specific reasons...",
  "experience_to_highlight": ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2"],
  "questions_to_ask": ["Question 1", "Question 2"]
}
```

## Step 6: Update Summary

Refresh `jobs_summary.md`:

```markdown
# Job Search Summary

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-15
**Total Jobs:** 47

## By Platform
- Greenhouse: 28
- Lever: 12

- Good Match (80-84): 24

## Top 10 Opportunities

| Score | Company | Role | Platform |
|-------|---------|------|----------|
| 94 | Grafana Labs | Staff Platform Engineer | Greenhouse |
| 92 | Temporal | Staff Infrastructure Engineer | Lever |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## New This Session
- [Job 1]
- [Job 2]

## Search Queries to Try Next
- [Untried query 1]
- [Untried query 2]
```

## Step 7: Track Progress

Note in summary:
- Queries that yielded good results (reuse variations)
- Queries that yielded nothing (don't repeat)
- Companies with multiple openings (monitor)
- Platforms with more untapped potential

## Remember

- **APPEND** to existing catalog, never overwrite
- **CHECK** for duplicate URLs before adding
- **FETCH** full job pages, not just search snippets
- **RESEARCH** companies not already in companies.json
- **SCORE** consistently using the rubric
- **PREPARE** specific, tailored application materials
- **VARY** search queries and platforms each session
